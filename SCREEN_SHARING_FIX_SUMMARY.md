# Screen Sharing Fix Summary

## Problem Description

Based on the user logs, there were two critical issues with screen sharing:

1. **Screen frames not visible**: Client 1 (UserG) could start screen sharing and the server confirmed it, but the shared screen was not visible to other clients.

2. **Presenter role not released**: After Client 1 stopped sharing, Client 2 (User) couldn't request presenter role because it was still "taken by UserG".

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Screen Frames Not Relayed

From the server logs:
```
2025-10-24 17:52:11,949 - server.network_handler - WARNING - Received screen frame from non-active sharer 2e648a1a-228f-4ee2-bc99-426042c6f044
```

The server was receiving screen frames from the presenter but rejecting them because `active_screen_sharer` was `None`. The `start_screen_sharing()` method was not setting the `active_screen_sharer` field.

### Issue 2: Presenter Role Not Released

When Client 1 stopped screen sharing, the presenter role remained assigned to them. The `stop_screen_sharing()` method was not clearing the presenter role, preventing other clients from taking over.

## Solution Implemented

### Fix 1: Set active_screen_sharer on Start

**File**: `server/session_manager.py`
**Method**: `start_screen_sharing()`

**Before**:
```python
self.screen_sharing_active = True
self.last_screen_frame_time = time.time()
```

**After**:
```python
self.screen_sharing_active = True
self.active_screen_sharer = client_id  # Set the active screen sharer
self.last_screen_frame_time = time.time()
```

### Fix 2: Clear active_screen_sharer on Stop

**File**: `server/session_manager.py`
**Method**: `stop_screen_sharing()`

**Before**:
```python
self.screen_sharing_active = False
self.last_screen_frame_time = None
```

**After**:
```python
self.screen_sharing_active = False
self.active_screen_sharer = None  # Clear the active screen sharer
self.last_screen_frame_time = None
```

### Fix 3: Clear Presenter Role on Stop

**File**: `server/session_manager.py`
**Method**: `stop_screen_sharing()`

**Added**:
```python
# Clear presenter role when screen sharing stops
if self.active_presenter:
    presenter = self.clients.get(self.active_presenter)
    if presenter:
        presenter.is_presenter = False
    self.active_presenter = None
    logger.info(f"Presenter role cleared when screen sharing stopped")
```

## Verification

### Test Results

All tests pass, confirming the fix works correctly:

1. ✅ `start_screen_sharing()` now sets `active_screen_sharer`
2. ✅ `stop_screen_sharing()` now clears `active_screen_sharer`
3. ✅ `stop_screen_sharing()` now clears presenter role
4. ✅ Multiple clients can now take turns as presenter
5. ✅ Screen frames are properly validated and relayed

### Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Screen Sharing Visible**: When a presenter starts screen sharing, their frames will be relayed to all other clients because `active_screen_sharer` is properly set.

2. **Presenter Role Transfer**: When screen sharing stops, the presenter role is cleared, allowing other clients to request it immediately.

3. **State Consistency**: All screen sharing state variables (`screen_sharing_active`, `active_screen_sharer`, `active_presenter`) are kept in sync.

## Impact

This fix resolves the core screen sharing functionality issues:

- Screen sharing will now be visible to all participants
- Multiple users can take turns presenting without server restart
- State management is consistent and thread-safe
- No breaking changes to existing API
